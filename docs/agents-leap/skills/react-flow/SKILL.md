# React Flow

## Overview

Use this skill to build, customize, debug, and optimize interactive node-based UIs with React Flow (@xyflow/react v12+). Covers everything from basic setup to advanced patterns like computed flows, sub-flows, and external layout integration.

## Agent behavior contract (follow these rules)

1. Always import from `@xyflow/react` — never from legacy `reactflow` or `react-flow-renderer` packages.
2. Always import the stylesheet: `import '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css'` (or `base.css` for custom styling frameworks).
3. The `<ReactFlow>` parent container **must** have explicit width and height — this is the #1 cause of blank canvases.
4. Define `nodeTypes` and `edgeTypes` objects **outside** component bodies or wrap in `useMemo` to prevent re-renders.
5. Prefer custom nodes over built-in nodes — the React Flow team explicitly recommends this.
6. Use the `nodrag` class on interactive elements inside custom nodes (inputs, buttons, selects).
7. Use `nowheel` class on scrollable elements inside custom nodes to prevent zoom interference.
8. When hiding handles, use `visibility: hidden` or `opacity: 0` — never `display: none` (breaks dimension calculation).
9. When using multiple handles of the same type on a node, always assign unique `id` props.
10. After programmatically adding/removing handles, call `useUpdateNodeInternals` to refresh the node.
11. Always create new objects when updating node/edge state — mutations are not detected by React Flow.
12. Prefer controlled flows for non-trivial applications. Wire `onNodesChange` and `onEdgesChange` for editable controlled elements, and add `onConnect` only when users can create connections.

## First 60 seconds (triage template)

- Clarify the goal: new flow setup, custom nodes/edges, state management, layout, performance, styling, E2E testing, advanced patterns (undo/redo, copy/paste, computed flows, collaboration), or debugging.
- Collect minimal facts:
  - React Flow version (v12+ uses `@xyflow/react`)
  - TypeScript or JavaScript
  - State management approach (local state, Zustand, Redux)
  - Number of nodes expected (affects performance strategy)
  - Styling approach (CSS, Tailwind, styled-components)
- Branch quickly:
  - migrating from legacy `reactflow` or `react-flow-renderer` -> package rename, import changes, API differences
  - blank canvas or missing nodes -> container dimensions or missing CSS import
  - edges not rendering -> missing handles, missing CSS, or `display: none` on handles
  - re-renders or sluggish performance -> nodeTypes defined inside component, missing memoization
  - connecting nodes not working -> missing `onConnect` handler or handle configuration
  - layout/positioning -> external layout library integration (dagre, elkjs)
  - type errors -> TypeScript generic patterns for Node/Edge types

## Routing map (read the right reference fast)

- Migrating from `reactflow` or `react-flow-renderer` to `@xyflow/react` v12 -> `references/migration.md`
- Installation, setup, first flow, node/edge objects -> `references/fundamentals.md`
- Custom node components, Handle, multiple handles, drag handles -> `references/custom-nodes.md`
- Custom edge components, path utilities, edge labels, markers -> `references/custom-edges.md`
- Event handlers, callbacks, connection validation, selection, keyboard -> `references/interactivity.md`
- Controlled vs uncontrolled, Zustand integration, state update patterns -> `references/state-management.md`
- Node/Edge types, generics, union types, type guards -> `references/typescript.md`
- External layout libraries (dagre, elkjs, d3), sub-flows, parent-child -> `references/layouting.md`
- Background, Controls, MiniMap, Panel, NodeToolbar, NodeResizer, hooks -> `references/components-and-hooks.md`
- Memoization, render optimization, theming, CSS variables, Tailwind -> `references/performance-and-styling.md`
- Common errors, debugging, edge display issues, Zustand warnings -> `references/troubleshooting.md`
- Playwright E2E tests, flow selectors, drag/viewport/connection testing -> `references/e2e-testing.md`
- Undo/redo, copy/paste, computed flows, dynamic handles, save/restore, collaboration -> `references/advanced-patterns.md`
- Context menu add node, drag-and-drop sidebar, detail panel, export as image -> `references/recipes.md`

## Common pitfalls -> next best move

- Blank canvas with no errors -> parent container has no height; set explicit `height: 100vh` or equivalent.
- `nodeTypes` / `edgeTypes` warning -> move object definition outside component body or wrap in `useMemo`.
- Edges render but in wrong position -> handles use `display: none`; switch to `opacity: 0`.
- Cannot interact with inputs inside nodes -> add `className="nodrag"` to interactive elements.
- Nodes snap back after drag -> `onNodesChange` not wired up or not applying changes correctly.
- Connection line appears but edge never creates -> `onConnect` handler missing or not calling `addEdge`.
- Multiple handles on same side overlap -> position them with CSS (`top` offset) and assign unique `id`s.
- State updates don't reflect in nodes -> creating mutations instead of new objects; spread operator required.
- Zustand context warning -> two versions of `@xyflow/react` installed or missing `<ReactFlowProvider>`.
- Sub-flow children mispositioned with "Parent node not found" warning -> ensure parent nodes appear before children in the `nodes` array.

## Verification checklist

- Confirm `@xyflow/react/dist/style.css` is imported (or `base.css` + custom styles).
- Confirm parent container has explicit width and height.
- Confirm `nodeTypes` / `edgeTypes` are stable references (defined outside component or memoized).
- Confirm custom nodes use `<Handle>` components with proper `type` and `position`.
- Confirm interactive elements inside nodes have `nodrag` class.
- Confirm controlled flows wire `onNodesChange`/`onEdgesChange` for editable elements and `onConnect` when connection creation is enabled.
- Confirm state updates create new node/edge objects (no mutations).
- Confirm TypeScript generics are applied to hooks and callbacks for type safety.
- Confirm performance-sensitive flows memoize custom node/edge components with `React.memo`.
